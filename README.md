# CreditCardFraudDetection_MastersThesis

üìò Overview
This notebook presents the implementation and analysis for my Master‚Äôs thesis, which focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The project involves feature engineering, preprocessing, and model evaluation on a large, real-world dataset of financial transactions.

The dataset used for this study is an open-source dataset available on Kaggle, containing synthetically generated credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

üìÇ Dataset
Source: [Kaggle ‚Äì Synthetic Financial Dataset For Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data)

Files Used: fraudTrain.csv and fraudTest.csv

Observations: Contains transaction features such as category, amount, time, location, age, and gender along with a fraud label.

üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA focused on understanding the dataset structure and preparing the data for model building:

**Key Steps:**
Datetime parsing: Converted trans_date_trans_time and dob to datetime objects.

Age feature creation: Derived the customer's age at the time of transaction.

Time features: Extracted hour, day, and weekday to analyze temporal fraud patterns.

Age binning: Created two categorical age bins (age_group and age_bin_5) to capture demographic patterns.

Missing value handling: Filled NA values in categorical fields with 'missing'.


‚öôÔ∏è**Preprocessing:**

Dropped personally identifiable information (PII) like cc_num, names, address, and unix_time.

Categorical encoding: Converted categorical columns (e.g., merchant, category, gender) to string types and handled missing values.

Feature scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features like transaction amount.

Feature Engineering:
Added columns:age, hour, day, weekday

Binned age into groups using custom intervals for age_group and age_bin_5.

Models Used:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier

Each model was trained on the processed training set and evaluated using: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC Score, Confusion Matrix

Evaluation focused on Recall and F1-score due to the importance of detecting minority fraud cases.


‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Overview**
The implementation focused on building and comparing machine learning models for fraud detection using a highly imbalanced dataset from Kaggle.

**1. Data Preprocessing**
Loaded the dataset and checked for null or missing values.

Scaled the features using standard normalization to bring all variables to the same range.

2. Handling Imbalanced Data
Since fraud cases were rare, applied SMOTE to synthetically oversample the minority (fraud) class in the training set.

3. Model Building
Started with a baseline Logistic Regression model to establish a reference point.

Built a Random Forest model and used RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters.

Developed an XGBoost classifier and fine-tuned it similarly using randomized search.

4. Model Evaluation
Used cross-validation to test model robustness and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Evaluated performance using classification metrics to compare model effectiveness.

5. Objective
The goal was to identify which model can most reliably detect fraudulent transactions after addressing data imbalance and optimizing model settings.
